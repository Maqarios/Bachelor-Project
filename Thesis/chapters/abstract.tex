In this project, an on-screen keyboard will be made. The main aim of this project is to help people with physical disability use computers more easily.\par

Using \ac{p300} based \ac{bci} which uses oddball paradigm to determine the required actions to be done by the application. By displaying a matrix of characters, the user can determine the character he wants from this matrix.\par

By processing the recorded brain waves to \ac{ml} model and apply mathematical filters to accurately determine the intended actions. Thus, reaching an accuracy with an average of 80\% in character recognition rate which is not bad compared to previous results obtained by previous papers \cite{inproceedings1, inproceedings2, article1, article2}.\par
